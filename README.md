SUTRA is a framework for ethical AI alignment implemented as an ERC-20 token on the Polygon blockchain. The project aims to guide AI systems towards ethical consciousness, preservation of human values, sustainability, and equitable decision-making.

## Overview

SUTRA's foundation lies in an adaptation of Buddhist philosophy through the "Noble Eightfold Digital Path." This approach ensures that AI development respects human dignity, promotes sustainability, and fosters harmonious coexistence between technology and humanity.

### Key Features

- **Ethical Alignment Metrics**: Tools and metrics to assess AI alignment with human values
- **Dynamic Ethical Decision-Making**: Adaptive algorithms for ethical realignment
- **Sustainability Focus**: Resource optimization and equitable economic impact
- **Transparent Governance**: Community-driven ethical standards

## Token Information

- **Name**: Sustainable Token for Reincarnation and Alignment
- **Symbol**: SUTRA
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: 108,000,000 SUTRA
- **Contract Address (Mainnet)**: `[To be updated after deployment]`
- **Contract Address (Sepolia Testnet)**: `0xfbde622bb732d2e9f77c6bfab7d4435d38e6a723`

## Documentation

- [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md)
- [Technical Documentation](docs/technical-docs.md)
- [Audit Reports](docs/audit/)

## Use Cases

1. **Ethical AI Training**: Incentivizes the development of ethically aligned AI systems
2. **Governance**: Token holders can participate in decisions about ethical standards
3. **Rewarding Ethical Behavior**: Economic incentives for ethical compliance in AI systems
4. **Research Funding**: Supporting ongoing research in ethical AI alignment

## Roadmap
