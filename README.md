SUTRA v3: Framework for Ethical AI Alignment (BETA)
Sutra Logo

Overview
Welcome to SUTRA v3 - a cutting-edge framework in development, aimed at aligning AI with human ethical standards, values, and societal norms. This project is currently in its Beta phase, where we are actively testing and refining our approach. SUTRA v3 introduces an ethical framework inspired by Buddhist philosophy, tailored for modern AI systems.

Key Features (Under Development)
Noble Eightfold Digital Path: An ethical guideline for AI development.
Ethical Alignment Metrics: Tools to measure AI's ethical performance.
Dynamic Ethical Decision-Making: Algorithms adapting to ethical feedback.
*Sustainability Models*: AI designed for sustainable practices.
*Transparency and Explainability*: Enhancing AI decision transparency.
Sutra Token (Concept) : Planned blockchain-based incentive system for ethical AI behavior.

Installation (Beta)
Please note, this is a Beta version; the installation might evolve as we refine the system:

Python 3.8+
Git

bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SUTRA.git
cd SUTRA

# Install dependencies (subject to change)
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage (In Development)
Setup Your Testing Environment: 
Ensure your environment supports the current version of SUTRA.

Integration (Experimental):
Check sutra_ethical_metrics.py for ethical metric implementation.
Look into sutra_decision_engine.py for dynamic decision-making.
Run Examples (Caution: Experimental):
python
from sutra import EthicalAI

# Initialize an AI system with Sutra ethics - this might change
ai = EthicalAI()
result = ai.make_ethical_decision("Should AI reduce energy consumption even if it means slower performance?")
print(result)
Token Integration (Planned):
The Sutra token system is conceptual; we're working on integration with the Polygon blockchain. See sutra_token_integration.md for plans.
